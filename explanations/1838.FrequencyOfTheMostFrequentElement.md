## Idea:

_Sliding windows. I hate sliding windows. Fuck sliding windows._

We need to find the **biggest subarray** that respect one condition: the number needed to make **all elements equal to the last** element of the subarray is less or equal than $k$ (the **number of operations** we can make).

To do that efficiently we need to use **sliding windows** _(again, fuck sliding windows)_, so that we can do that in $O(n)$, iterating the array just once.

Iterate over elements of $nums$, this will be the **end of the window** _(it will increase by 1 position each iteration)_:

calculate the **new amount** neeeded by each new end using the formula:\
$newAmount = oldAmount + ((newEnd - oldEnd) \times oldSize)$.\
The idea is that the **each element** of the **old subarray** can be transformed to the old **last element** using $oldAmount$ of operations. So we can simply add the **difference** between the **old end** and **new end** to **each element** to calculate the new amount needed, so $(newEnd - oldEnd) \times oldSize$.

If the amount is **bigger** than the number of operations we can make (`k`) than we need to **scale down the size of the subarray**, bringing the start to the left.

This works only it the elements are **sorted**.

## Solution:

- **sort** items _(so that we can use some sort of **prefix sum**)_
- initialize our sliding **window**: `start` and `end` (both inclusive), so size is (`end`-`start`) + 1
- initialize maximum size of subarray that respects the condition (`maxSize`)
- keep **expanding** the windows (moving the `newEnd` to the left):
  - save old end (`nums[end]`)
  - calculate old size (`end` - `start` + 1)
  - calculate **new amount** (`newAmount`) needed to make all elements same as `newEnd`: old amount (`amount`) + the difference between `oldEnd` and `newEnd` multiplied by old size (`oldSize`)
  - if the new amount is **too big** (`> k`): make the window smaller by bringing start closer to end (move to left) **until it is small enough**
    - remove from `newAmount` the amount needed by the **first element**
    - move **start**
  - update `end`
  - update amount needed `diff`
  - save size if it is **the biggest** found yet (`maxSize = max(...)`)

## Code:
```python
def maxFrequency(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:

  nums.sort()

  start, end = 0, 0
  amount = 0

  maxSize = 1

  for newEnd in nums[1:]:
    oldEnd = nums[end]
    oldSize = (end-start) + 1

    newAmount = amount + ((newEnd - oldEnd) * oldSize)

    while newAmount > k and start < len(nums):
      newAmount -= (newEnd - nums[start])
      start += 1

    end += 1
    amount = newAmount

    maxSize = max(maxSize, ((end-start)+1))

  print(maxSize)
  return maxSize
```

## Other ideas:

- Calculate the size of the **biggest subarray possible** for **each element** iterating **from the element backwards** until the **sum is bigger than k**
  - working but too slow: time limit exceeded
