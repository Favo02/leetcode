## Idea:

Iterate from the **end** of the array. If the **current element** is **smaller** than the **element before** it then we should **break the before element into multiple pieces**, to preserve _non-decreasing order_.\
The **number of pieces** the before element should be broken into is the **minimum possible**, but also **each new element** should be **as big as possible** _(so that there are less chances that a bigger element is found proceeding the visit)_.

## Solution:

- iterate from **end** of array
- if **current element** (`nums[i]`) is **smaller** than **before element** (`nums[i-1]`)
  - calculate the **number of parts** the element should be broken into (number of parts to make the new elements all smaller than current element): `math.ceil(before / current)`
  - save number of **operations done** (new parts, so total parts **- 1 already existing**): `count += parts-1`
  - calculate value of **new smallest element**: `before[i-1] // parts`. The new elements should be **sorted in non-decreasing** order too. If the _before element_ is divisible by the _number of parts_ the division will be a **whole number**, so **all new elements will be the same**. Otherwise the **smallest element should be the first**, so we use **integer division** to get the smallest of new elements _(127 in 4 parts is 31+32+32+32. 127 // 4 gives 31)_

## Code:
```python
class Solution:
  def minimumReplacement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)-1, 0, -1):
      if nums[i] < nums[i-1]:
        p = math.ceil(nums[i-1] / nums[i])
        count += p-1
        nums[i-1] = nums[i-1] // p
    print(count)
    return count
```
