## Idea:

Printing the first full rows a **pattern** is clear:

- each row **double its length**
- the **first half** of the new row is **exactly the last row**
- the **second part** is the first part **flipped**

0\
01\
**01**10\
**0110**1001

Let's now _suppose_ that I know the **full row** before the target row `n` (let's say `n` is 4, so I know 3rd row `0110`).\
If `k` is **smaller than half** the length of `n` then I can simply **pick it from last row** (that I know).\
Otherwise, I can simply pick `k - (lenght(n)/2)` and **flip it**.

But I **don't know** the row before `n`, so I **keep doing** the above algorithm until I reach row `0`, that is _known_, keeping track of _how many times_ I **flip** the bit.

## Solution:

- initialize flip bit (`inverse`) to false
- keep iterating until I reach row `0` (`n > 0`):
  - calculate current **row length** (`lenRow`)
  - if the **target bit** (`k`) is bigger than **half the row** (**NOT** already present in _previous row_):
    - target is the bit at position `k - (row length / 2)` **flipped** (`inverse = not inverse`)
  - otherwise target bit (`k`) was already in _previous row_:
    - no need to do nothing
  - decrease row
- return `1` if bit needs flipping (`inverse == True`), `0` otherwise

## Code:
```python
class Solution:
  def kthGrammar(self, n, k):
    inverse = False
    while n > 0:
      lenRow = 2**n
      if k > (lenRow // 2):
        k -= (lenRow // 2)
        inverse = not inverse
      n -= 1
    return 1 if inverse else 0
```

## Other ideas:

- calculating each row (keeping in memory only one array and operating in-place on it)
  - memory limit exceeded
