## Idea:

Start watering **from left side** of the garden. Find **biggest tap** that **waters the leftmost** piece of garden, to _not leave any gap_ behind.\
Then _keep looking_ for the **biggest** tap to water the **leftmost** piece of garden still **not watered**.

If the leftmost piece _cannot_ be watered then the _whole garden_ cannot be completely watered.

## Solution:

- **calculate range** of every tap
- **sort** ranges (to _optimize_ search of tap to water leftmost piece of garden) 
- initialize `next`: the index of the next piece of garden than _needs to be watered_
- initialize `lastInd`: index of _last tap opened_, needed to _optimize the search_ of the biggest tap starting from a given point. Every tap _before_ this index is **starting before** the point we want to water and is **not the biggest** to cover this point, so it will **not** be the biggest to water **next point either**
- initialize `count`: number of _taps opened_
- start **iterating** until the _whole garden_ in watered (next point to be watered is greather than end of garden: `while next < n`):
  - _increment count_ of taps opened
  - **search biggest tap** that waters the first point of garden (start iterating _from last opened tap_, as explained before):
    - **stop looking** if the current range start (`r[0]`) is greather than `next`: every next tap _starting range_ is _further to the right_ than the point we need to water
    - if the current tap (`r`) range **starts** (`r[0]`) **before** `next` and is **bigger** than max already found (`max`):
      - _save current_ as biggest: update saved index (`maxI`) and `max`
  - if _no tap_ to water leftmost point is found (`maxI` still `-1`):
    - the garden _cannot be watered_: `return -1`
  - otherwise the leftmost point (and some other points) has been watered, update _next point_ to be watered (`next = ranges[maxI][1]`) and _used tap index_ (`lastInd = maxI`) to optimize search
- return number of _taps opened_

## Code:
```python
class Solution:
  def minTaps(self, n: int, ranges: List[int]) -> int:

    ranges = list(map(lambda ran : (ran[0]-ran[1], ran[0]+ran[1]), enumerate(ranges)))
    ranges.sort(key=lambda t : t[0])

    next = 0
    lastInd = 0
    count = 0
    while next < n:
      count += 1

      max = 0
      maxI = -1
      for i in range(lastInd, len(ranges)):
        r = ranges[i]

        if r[0] > next:
          break
        if r[0] <= next and (r[1]-next) > max:
          max = r[1]-next
          maxI = i

      if maxI == -1:
        print(-1)
        return -1

      next = ranges[maxI][1]
      lastInd = maxI

    print(count)
    return count
```

## Other ideas:

- Search each time the range that **waters the most points**, then **set** this **points as watered** and **search again** for the range that waters the most points **not watered yet**
  - Problem: **fragmentation**, the biggest range could be in the middle and to fill small gaps at the edges more operations are required than using _smaller_ but _contiguos_ ranges
  - Problem: if two or more ranges has _same number _of points watered _both_ needs to be _tried_
- Same as last solution, but with **recursion** to **try all intervals with same value**
  - Implemented: **too slow**
