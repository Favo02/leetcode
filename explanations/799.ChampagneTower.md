## Idea:

The idea is to **simulate** the falling of the champagne: a quantity of champagne falls into a glass. If the quantity (+ the quantity already there) **is greather than 1** then fill the **two glasses below**.\
The problem is do that in an _efficient way_: **recursion** is way too slow and even a **basic iterative** approach (based on a **queue**: instead of calling recursion when the champagne falls, the glass below and the quantity are added to a queue) is too slow.

The key is **save all quantities** that will fall into a glass into a **buffer**, and simulate if **only when all the precedent row** is over, so that a glass will be filled **only** one time.\
Another improvement is to save only the last simulated row, the rows above it are useless, so we can save some space by not saving the whole pyramid but only the last row.

## Solution:

- while the **simulated row** is **smaller** than the **row containing the targe**t do:
  - move the generated row (`nextRow`) into the **old** variable (`lastRow`)
  - generate new **empty row** of lenght `row+1` (`nextRow`)
  - iterate the glasses of **precedent row** (`lastRow`):
    - if quantity (`qty`) is **greather than 1** then:
      - calculate **quantity falling off** (`(qty-1) / 2`)
      - **save quantity** in the two glasses below (`index`, `index+1`)
  - move to next row
- return the glass requested by problem of last simulated row

## Code:
```python
class Solution:
  def champagneTower(self, poured: int, query_row: int, query_glass: int) -> float:
    
    row = 0
    nextRow = [ poured ]

    while row <= query_row:
      lastRow = nextRow
      nextRow = [0 for _ in range(row+2)]
      # print(lastRow, nextRow)

      for index, qty in enumerate(lastRow):

        if qty > 1:
          lastRow[index] = 1
          qty = (qty-1) / 2

          nextRow[index] += qty
          nextRow[index+1] += qty

      row += 1

    print(lastRow[query_glass])
    return lastRow[query_glass]
```

## Other ideas:

- **Recursive** approach: call the recursive funcion on glass 0 with poured as quantity, if > 1 then call recursively the two glasses below with reduced quantity
  - Implemented: working
  - Problem: too slow, time exceeded
- **Iterative with queue**: same idea as recursive, but instead of calling recursion save into a queue (glass, qty) that falls of, _but without stacking them_, so a glass will be present in the queue multiple times
  - Implemented: working
  - Problem: too slow, slower even than recursive
  - Improvements: stack glasses in the queue, resulting in this solution
