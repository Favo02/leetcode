## Idea:

The ants _meeting_ and _changing direction_ are just a **big bait**, the behaviour is exactly the same as if they **simply keep walking** in the **same direction** after meeting _(the ants swap, but we don't care)_.

So the solution is simply to find the **ant furthest away** from the **end of the plank**.

## Solution:

- if left array _isn't empty_:
  - find the ant **furthest away** from the **left end of the plank** (the furthest away from `0`), so the `max` in the array
- if right array _isn't empty_:
  - find the ant **furthest away** from the **right end of the plank** (the furthest away from `n`), so the `n - min` in the array
- return furthest away between **furthest going left and furthest going right**

## Code:
```python
class Solution:
  def getLastMoment(self, n: int, left: List[int], right: List[int]) -> int:
    l, r = 0, 0
    if left:
      l = max(left)
    if right:
      r = n - min(right)
    return max(l,r)
```
