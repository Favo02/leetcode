## Idea:

The number of operations to trasform `n` into `0` is **the same** needed to **build up** `n` from `0`.

So we just need to calculate the time needed to **build up each bit**: $2^{position} -1$ (where position is _starting from the right_).

```
0 to 1:
1 = 1 = 2^1 -1

00 to 10:
01
11
10 = 3 = 2^2 -1

000 to 100:
001
011
010
110
111
101
100 = 2^3 -1
```

The problem is that in the **meantime of building a bit**, we could **obtain** a state that is going to **save us some operations**, an example:\
we want to calculate the operations needed for `101`, using the formula above: $2^3-1 + 2^1-1 = 7 + 1 = 8$

```
000 to 101
001 <- start building first (leftmost) 1 bit
011
010
110
111
101 <- this is already the result
100
101 <- start building second (rightmost) 1 bit
```

We could have _saved_ 2 operations, the correct result is $6$, because in the process of building up the leftmost 1 bit we _accidentally encountered_ the result.

The operations saved are **exactly** the operations needed to **build up the next bit**: the trick _(spotted by simulating a few trasformations)_ is to **alternate** a **sum** and **subtract**.

`000 to 101`: $2^3-1 - 2^1-1 = 7 - 1 = 6$
`000000 to 101101`: $2^6-1 - 2^4-1 + 2^3-1 - 2^1-1 = 63 - 15 + 7 - 1 = 54$

## Solution:

- trasform `n` into a list of `0` and `1`
- initialize result (`res`)
- initialize a _switch_ to keep track of alternating _sums_ and _subs_
- iterate bits of `n`:
  - if bit is `1`:
    - **calculate** number of operations to build this bit (`2**(len(n)-i)-1`)
    - **flip** operation (`flipOp = not flipOp`)
  - **sum or subtract** from result the value calculated
- because of alternating _sums_ and _subs_, the result _could be_ negative, return **absolute value**

## Code:
```python
def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
  n = [int(c) for c in list(bin(n)[2:])]

  res = 0
  flipOp = True
  for i,s in enumerate(n):
    val = 0
    if s == 1:
      val = 2**(len(n)-i)-1
      flipOp = not flipOp

    if flipOp: res += val
    else: res -= val

  print(abs(res))
  return abs(res)
```
