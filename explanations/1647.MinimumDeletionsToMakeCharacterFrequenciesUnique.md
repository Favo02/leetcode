# Python3 #1647 solution - 169 ms (70.45%) - 15 MB (15.91%)

## Solution:

- count **frequency** of all characters (using `countFreq`, O(n))
- start an infinite loop
  - check if no char has the same frequency, using `isOver` function (returns `True` if no chars have the same frequency)
  - if not over, `isOver` returns the **character with the same frequency** as another. _In both cases isOver returns a true-ish value, so the check for `True` needs to be explicit (`over == True`)._
    - **increment counter** of chars removed
    - **remove** first occurrence of the character selected by `isOver` with the same freq as another
    - **decrease frequency** in the frequency dictionary
      - if new frequency is 0 then **remove from dict** (otherwise there could be more characters at 0 not ending the loop)

## Code:
```
def countFreq(str):
  freq = {}
  for s in str:
    if s in freq:
      freq[s] += 1
    else:
      freq[s] = 1
  return freq

def isOver(freq):
  for f1 in freq:
    for f2 in freq:
      if f1 == f2:
        continue
      if freq[f1] == freq[f2]:
        return f1
  return True
 
def solve(s):
  count = 0
  freq = countFreq(s)

  while True:
    over = isOver(freq)
    if over == True: # explicit check for True, over can be True or a characted (always true-ish value)
      return count

    count+=1
    index = s.index(over)
    s = s[0:index] + s[index+1:]
    freq[over] -= 1
    if freq[over] == 0:
      del freq[over]
