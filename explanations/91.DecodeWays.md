## Idea:

For **each character** in the string, check if it **could be in a couple** (with the _next character_). If the _couple is valid_, **simulate for both the couple** and **the character alone**, _otherwise_ simulate for the **character alone only**.

Do that **recursively**. We need _memoization_ to improve performances and _avoid TLE_ (a lot of recursive calls are repeated).

## Solution:

- call **recursive function** on **full string**
- _recursive function `solve`:_
  - check for _memoization_
  - if **length of string is 0**:
    - we **reached** the end of the string **correctly**, there is **only one possible solution** in this branch of the tree _(each recursive call is branching the possible solutions, forming a tree)_
  - if **string starts with `"0"`**:
    - **not a valid string** to decode, **no** possible **solutions**
  - if **length of string is 1** (and is not `"0"`):
    - **one possible solution** (every digit except `"0"` alone is valid)
  - **length** of string is **2 or greather**: we need to check _both cases_, when the **next character is alon**e and when it is in a **couple**
    - if _next two characters_ can form a **valid couple**:
      - solve on string **removing first characte**r (`s[1:]`) and on string **removing first two characters** (`s[2:]`)
    - _otherwise_ next two characters are **not a valid couple**:
      - solve on string **removing only first character** (`s[1:]`)
  - save result in _memoization_

## Code:
```python
def solve(s, mem={}):
  if s in mem:
    return mem[s]

  res = None

  # end of string reached, one possible solution
  if len(s) == 0:
    res = 1
  # string starting with "0", impossible to decode, no solutions
  elif s[0] == "0":
    res = 0
  # string of length 1 (not "0"), one possible solution
  elif len(s) == 1:
    res = 1
  # long string, check wheter next two digits can be a couple
  else:
    a, b = int(s[0]), int(s[1])
    # valid next two digits as a couple,
    # check both cases where next digit is alone and where are a couple
    if (a == 1) or (a == 2 and b <= 6):
      res = solve(s[1:], mem) + solve(s[2:], mem)
    # not possible: solve only for first digit alone
    else:
      res = solve(s[1:], mem)

  mem[s] = res
  return res

class Solution:
  def numDecodings(self, s: str) -> int:
    res = solve(s)
    print(res)
    return res
```
