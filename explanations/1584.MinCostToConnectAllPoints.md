## Idea:

The points form a **strongly connected graph** (clique). Find the **minimum spanning tree** for that graph and count the weight of the tree.
Use a simplified _(and less performant)_ version of **Prim algorithm** to do so.

## Solution:

- convert points from list of 2 values to tuple (to allow hashing for dict)
- find **minimum spanning tree** using `prim`
  - initialize a **tree** with only start as point in it
  - calculate manhattan distance to **all points not already in tree**, save this in `available` _(available: minimum distance from a point to a generic point in the tree)_
  - while the **size of the tree** is smaller than the **number of points**:
    - find the **closest point to the current tree** (find min in available), **not already in tree**
    - add the closest (`min`) to **tree**
    - add the **weight** of this new added edge to total weight
    - **recalculate the distance** from newly added point to all points not in tree, replace the current available only if smaller than **existing distance**. This will assure that the distances in available are always relative to the closest point in the tree and not a single point

## Code:
```python
def prim(points, start):

  w = 0
  tree = set()
  tree.add(start)

  available = {}
  for p in points:
    if p in tree: continue
    available[p] = manDistance(start, p)

  while len(tree) < len(points):

    min = 1_000_000_000_000
    minP = None
    for k in available:
      if k in tree: continue
      if available[k] < min:
        min = available[k]
        minP = k

    tree.add(minP)
    w += min

    for p in points:
      if p in tree: continue
      md = manDistance(minP, p)
      if md < available[p]:
        available[p] = md

  return tree, w
    
manDistance = lambda p1, p2 : abs(p1[0]-p2[0]) + abs(p1[1]-p2[1])
