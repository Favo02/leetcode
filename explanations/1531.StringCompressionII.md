## Idea:

For each position in the string, try both to **keep the character and to remove it**. Calculate the **compression length** and keep only the smallest.

The _hard part_ is doing that _efficiently_: use a lot of **memoization** and **prune states** that cannot satisfy the request.

## Solution:

- `group_size` function: calculate the **size of a group** given its **characters count**
  - if count is `0` or `None`: the group is **empty**, result 0
  - if count is `1`: there is **only one character**, result 1 (as `a` is not encoded `a1` but only `a`)
  - otherwise count in **greather than 1**: the algorithm will compress `aaa` into `a3`, so the result is the **number of digits in the count** plus 1 (the **character itself**)

- `solve` function: return the **minimum** size for a `string`, removing exactly `to_remove` characters (`index` is the index that needs to be removed or kept, `last_char` and `last_count` describe the last group)
  - check if the **current state** (all parameters except `string` that is always the same) has **already been calculated** (is in **memoization**)
  - if the current index (`index`) has **reached the end** of the string (`len(string)`), the result is the **size of the current group** (`group_size(last_count)`)
  - otherwise we need to **try both removing and keeping the current character**: initialize `keep` and `remove`
  - try to **keep** the current character. _(Prune some recursive calls:)_ we should keep only if there are **enough characters past the current one** that **can be removed**:
    - if the **group is not interrupted**:
      - the size is the recursive call with **increased index** (`index+1`) and **increased group size** (`last_count+1`)
    - otherwise, a **new group is started**: we need to calculate the **size of the just ended group** to **add to the total**
      - **last group size** `group_size(last_count)` + **recursive call** on the new group (last_char = `string[index]`, last_count = `1`)
  - try to **remove** the current character. _(Prune some recursive calls:)_ we should remove only if we have the **right to do so** (we still have some **"remove tokens"** left) (`to_remove > 0`):
    - the size is the recursive call **skipping the current character**, in other words, the recursive call **forwarding the parameter**s of the previous call, updating only **index** (`index+1`) and the **remove tokens left** (`to_remove-1`)
  - we then return the **minimum** size between the _keep_ and _remove_ strategies (`min(keep, remove)`)

## Code:
```python
def group_size(count):
  if not count:
    return 0
  if count == 1:
    return 1
  return 1 + len(str(count))

def solve(string, index, last_char, last_count, to_remove, mem) -> int:
  if (index, last_char, last_count, to_remove) in mem:
    return mem[(index, last_char, last_count, to_remove)]

  if index == len(string):
    mem[(index, last_char, last_count, to_remove)] = group_size(last_count)
    return group_size(last_count)

  keep = float("inf")
  remove = float("inf")

  # keep: there are enough characters to be removed past this index
  if to_remove <= len(string) - (index+1):

    # contigous group
    if last_char == string[index]:
      keep = solve(string, index+1, last_char, last_count+1, to_remove, mem)
    # different character: new group
    else:
      keep = group_size(last_count) + solve(string, index+1, string[index], 1, to_remove, mem)

  # remove: there are enough "remove token" left
  if to_remove > 0:
    remove = solve(string, index+1, last_char, last_count, to_remove-1)

  mem[(index, last_char, last_count, to_remove)] = min(keep, remove)
  return min(keep, remove)

class Solution:
  def getLengthOfOptimalCompression(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
    res = solve(s, 0, None, None, k, {})
    print(res)
    return res
