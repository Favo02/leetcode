## Idea:

The idea is to build up the **number of possible** different phone numbers (or **paths**) just by counting the number of each possible **end position**.

We do that using **induction**: we start by placing a knight on _each position_ (each position will have value `1`).\
Then we iterate for the _number of jumps_ and each iteration we **update** the positions by **summing all** the positions that **can jump** to current position.

## Solution:

- _initialize modulo for larger solutions_
- **hardcode** the **possible destinations** the knight can reach standing on each position _(the index of the array is the position the knight is standing on)_
- initialize the result: the number of **paths ending** on **each position** _(at the start we place a knight on each position, so all `1`)_
- iterate `n-1` times (we already _dialed one number_ by initializing the `last` array to `1`):
  - initialize current result `newLast` (we will have to access the old `last` while iterating, so we cannot modify in place)
  - iterate over each place:
    - calculate the **new value** for each position by **summing up all the old values** (in `last`) that **can jump** to current position (`curPlace`)
    - add result to new result (`newLast`)
  - swap old result (`last`) with the newly calculated (`newLast`)
- **sum** the resulting array `sum(last)` and apply modulo (`% MOD`)

## Code:
```python
def knightDialer(self, n: int) -> int:
  MOD = 10**9 + 7

  jumps = [[4,6],[6,8],[7,9],[4,8],[0,3,9],[],[0,1,7],[2,6],[1,3],[2,4]]
  last = [1 for _ in range(10)]

  for _ in range(n-1):
    newLast = []
    for curPlace in range(10):
      res = 0
      for j in jumps[curPlace]:
        res = (res + last[j]) % MOD
      newLast.append(res)

    last = newLast

  res = sum(last) % MOD
  print(res)
  return res
```
