## Idea:

A "simple" **minimum path on a graph**, twisted a bit by saving only the **maximum difference** between adjacent points instead of total distance.
The only difference to dijkstra algorithm is the greedy comparison: save a new "shortest path" (in this problem minimum efford to reach the point) only if it is smaller than the current one. The minimum efford to compare is the maximum between the **max efford to reach current point** and the **efford to go to adjacent point**. 

## Solution:

- initialize a queue (**heap**) with the start point, with 0 efford to reach it (the efford is first in the tuple for sorting of the `heapq` heap)
- set efford to reach `start` to 0
- while the queue is **not empty**:
  - pop point with **smallest efford** from queue _(heap)_
  - if the point reached is the target then break cycle
  - generate **adjacent points** (up, down, left, right)
  - iterate adjacent points:
    - calculate **new efford**: difference in height between **current point** (`cur`) and **adjacent point** (`a`)
    - the efford of the path is the **maximum** between the efford to **reach current point** (`cur`) and the **new generated efford** (`newEfford`)
    - if the calculated efford is **smaller than current saved** efford to reach the adjacent point (or it hasnt been reached yet):
      - save efford to reach adjacent point
      - add adjacent point to **queue** with relative efford
