# Python3 #2050 solution - 1414 ms (80.59%) - 85 MB (19.12%)

## Idea:

Reconstruct the **path of each course**, calculating its **length** _(in time)_. Return the **longest**.

## Solution:

- initialize **memoization** array (to _cache_ already calculated paths)
- covert relations _1-indexed_ array to _0-indexed_ array (`list(map(...))`)
- build graph (using `buildGraph` function):
  - initialize a _bidimensional array_: **each course has its precedent courses** _(courses needed to take it)_
  - iterate **relations**: each course will have a list of all its **direct** previous courses:
    - save into the **next** (`graph[next]`) course the **previous** (`prev`) course _(prev is the course needed to take next)_
- iterate **each course**:
  - calculate the **total** _(all previuos + course)_ **time needed** to complete the course using `calcTime` function:
    - check if the target is _already calculated_ (`mem[target] != -1`)
    - _initialize total time_ needed to the time for _only current course_ (`curmax = time[target]`)
    - iterate **all previous** courses needed:
      - calculare **recursively** the time for **this previous course** (`calcTime(prev, graph, time)`) and **sum** to the time of _current_ course (`time[target] + ...`)
      - _save_ the result into `curmax` if it is _greater than the other values_ calculated
    - save the result into `mem[target]` to **cache it**
- _save_ the result into `res` if it is greater than the _values of other courses_
- return _result_ (`res`)

## Code:
```python
def buildGraph(n, relations):
  graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
  for prev, next in relations:
    graph[next].append(prev)
  return graph

def calcTime(target, graph, time):
  if mem[target] != -1:
    return mem[target]

  curmax = time[target]
  for prev in graph[target]:
    curmax = max(curmax, time[target] + calcTime(prev, graph, time))

  mem[target] = curmax
  return curmax

class Solution:
  def minimumTime(self, n: int, relations: List[List[int]], time: List[int]) -> int:

    global mem
    mem = [-1 for _ in range(n)]

    relations = list(map(lambda r: (r[0]-1, r[1]-1), relations))
    graph = buildGraph(n, relations)

    res = 0
    for course in range(n):
      res = max(res, calcTime(course, graph, time))

    print(res)
    return res
```

## Other ideas:

- Build a _graph_ and apply **Floyd-Warshall** algorithm to find the _shortest path_ to _reach each_ node _from each_ node. Then find the **longest path**
  - not implemented but _should_ work
  - due to the _acyclical nature_ of the input, a shortest path algorithm works but simpler (and _better performing_) algorithms can be used
