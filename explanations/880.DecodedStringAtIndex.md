## Idea:

The idea is to divide into **blocks** the given string: each block has its **own total value** (number of letters * time block repeated).\
Then **keep subtracting** from `k` blocks until `k` is **small enough** to **iterate over** a block of **letters without numbers**.

## Solution:

- **generate blocks**: each block has 3 values (stored in 3 parallel lists):
  - **total size** (`sizes`): size repeating **the whole block** for its number times. Total size should **keep track of smaller repeating blocks**, so the formula is:\
  $ newLettersInBlock + (digitAtEnd-1) \times ((\sum beforeBlocks) + newLettersInBlock) $
  - index (`indexes`): index on `s` string after the block, the **position** to place the "cursor" **after the block is used**
  - letters (`letters`): **number of letters in the block** without digits, needed to check if `k` is small enough
- initialize a cursor on `s` string to keep track of **current position** (`cursorInd`). -1 because `k` is 1-indexed.
- initialize index on blocks array (`blockInd`)
- start **iterating**:
  - if `k` is **small enough** that it **doesn't need any digit** (`<= letters[blockInd]`), then return the current cursor position + k (`cursorInd + k`)
  - if `k` is **bigger than the whole repeated next block**: use the block
    - **subtrack from k** the size of the block (`k -= sizes[blockInd]`)
    - **move cursor** to end of block (`cursorInd = indexes[blockInd]`)
    - go to **next block** (`blockInd += 1`)
  - last case: k is **not small enough** to iterate over the letters of the **current block (without repetitions)**, but **not big enough** to **skip the whole next block**. Reset to start and **start jumping smaller blocks**, until k is small enough:
    - use k to **reach end of current block** (reach digit at end of current block, to "trigger" repetition) (`k -= letters[blockInd]`)
    - **reset cursor** on `s` (`cursorInd = -1`)
    - **reset block index** (`blockInd = 0`)

## Code:
```python
def genBlocks(s):
  sizes = []
  indexes = []
  letters = []
  count = 0
  for i, c in enumerate(s):
    if c.isdigit() or i == len(s)-1:
      size = count + ((int(c)-1) * (sum(sizes) + count) if c.isdigit() else 1)
      sizes.append(size)
      indexes.append(i)
      letters.append(count if c.isdigit() else count+1)
      count = 0
    else:
      count += 1

  return sizes, indexes, letters

class Solution:
  def decodeAtIndex(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
  
    sizes, indexes, letters = genBlocks(s)
    # print(sizes)
    # print(indexes)
    # print(letters)
    
    cursorInd = -1
    blockInd = 0
    while True:
      if k <= letters[blockInd]:
        return s[cursorInd + k]

      if k > sizes[blockInd]:
        k -= sizes[blockInd]
        cursorInd = indexes[blockInd]
        blockInd += 1
        continue
  
      k -= letters[blockInd]
      cursorInd = -1
      blockInd = 0
```

## Other ideas:

- **Generate the whole string** and then find `k`
  - Problems: string too big
- **Simulate** the generation of whole string, **keeping only an index** on `s`, until `k` is reached
  - Implemented, working
  - Problems: **too slow** for big `k`
- **Generate blocks** but a block size **includes also the size of before blocks**: basically only the **last block** (the one before its too big for `k`) gets jumped. Then **start iterating** like in the _"Simulate the generation of whole string..."_ solution
  - Implemented, working
  - Problems: skipping a whole block is not enough, the remaing `k` is **still too large**
  - The working solution is an **improved version** of this solution, with a **different division** in blocks
