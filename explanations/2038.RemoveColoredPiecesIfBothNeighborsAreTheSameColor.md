## Idea:

Keep track of the last found position of a valid triplet for each player. On the turn of a player, find the next valid triplet. If there aren't any, the other players wins.

## Solution:

- initialize turn and `keep` (when a player cannot find a valid triplet, stop iterating)
- initialize last triplet position for each player
- start iterating while a valid triplet is found (`keep`):
  - get the color of the current player (`colTurn = 'A' if turn else 'B'`)
  - get the last found position of a valid triplet for the current player (`startTurn = ai if turn else bi`)
  - iterate over the colors starting from the last found position + 1 (`startTurn + 1`)
    - if the current color is the same as the previous and the next one (valid triplet):
      - save last triplet found (`ai = c` or `bi = c`): the first letter of the triplet will not be found in next iterations
      - change turn (`turn = not turn`)
      - keep iterating (a valid triplet was found)
- return the opposite of the player who didn't had any valid truplet (`return not turn`)

## Code:
```python
class Solution():
  def winnerOfGame(self, colors):
    turn = True
    keep = True
    ai = 0
    bi = 0
    while keep:
      colTurn = 'A' if turn else 'B'
      startTurn = ai if turn else bi
      keep = False
      for c in range(startTurn+1, len(colors)-1):
        if colTurn == colors[c-1] == colors[c] == colors[c+1]:
          if turn:
            ai = c
          else:
            bi = c
          turn = not turn
          keep = True
          break
          
    print("res",not turn)
    return not turn
```

- Count the number of valid triplets for each player: the one with more wins
