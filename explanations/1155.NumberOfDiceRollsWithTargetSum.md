## Idea:

For **each dice left to toss simulate** each possible **face of the die**, until we have **no dice** left to toss. If we **reached perfectly** the target, then that was a **valid combination**, increment the result, otherwise skip it.

That can be done **recursively**, _pruning_ the possible solutions _before reaching no dice left to toss_, checking if the **target is reachable** with the number of dice left to toss.

Another improvement to the performances is **memoization**, as a lot of calls will be repeated a lot of times.

## Solution:

- call recursive function `solve`, that thakes the number of faces for each die (`DIE_FACES`), the number of dice left to toss (`dice`), the target to reach (`target`), the memoization table (`mem`), the modulo (`MOD`)
  - check if result is already available in _memoization_
  - if we **reached the end** (**no dice left** to toss):
    - **result is 1**, because we **already removed** all **invalid** states. It is _impossible_ to reach `dice == 0` with `target != 0` _(checked by an assertion)_
  - otherwise we have **some dice to toss**:
    - iterate over **every possible face**:
      - **skip invalid states** (according to the face _just selected_):
        - the dice left are **too few** to reach target (even if every dice is the _maximum possible_, `DIE_FACES`, target is _not reached_)
        - the dice left are **too many** to reach target (even if every dice is the _minimum possible_, `1`, target is _exceeded_)
      - get **all possible combination**s that reach target **with the selected face**, **calling recursively** `solve`, with one less dice (`dice-1`) and target updated (`target-face`)
  - _apply modulo to the result_
  - save solution in _memoization_

## Code:
```python
def solve(DIE_FACES, dice, target, mem, MOD):
  if (dice, target) in mem:
    return mem[(dice, target)]

  res = 0

  # no dice left to toss, 1 possible combination
  if dice == 0:
    # the target is always 0 due to the checks before the recursive call
    assert target == 0
    res = 1

  # one or more dice to tosses
  else:
    # try every face
    for face in range(1, DIE_FACES+1):
      # that is not too small to reach target with the tosses left
      if (dice-1)*DIE_FACES < target-face:
        continue
      # or not too big to reach target with the tosses left
      if dice-1 > target-face: # (dice-1)*1 as 1 is the smallest toss possible
        break
      res += solve(DIE_FACES, dice-1, target-face, mem, MOD)

  mem[(dice, target)] = res % MOD
  return res % MOD

class Solution:
  def numRollsToTarget(self, n: int, k: int, target: int) -> int:
    res = solve(k, n, target, {}, 10**9 + 7)
    print(res)
    return res
```
