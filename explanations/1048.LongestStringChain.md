## Idea:

Given a word, calculate the maximum chain number for **each possible substring** (removing **only one** character): remove one character at a time and calculate the maximum number of chain for this substring. This is obviously done by **recursion** (calling the same funcion for every substring). The base case of recursion is: the **substring is not in the words** array (result 1).\
Do this for every word in nums and return the max possible chain.

To improve performances start calculating from the **longest string**, a longest chain is _more likely_ with a longest word. If the word we are calculating the chain is **shorter** than the **current found chain** then there is no point even calculating the chain for this word: it is **impossible** that a word of lenght 4 will find a longer chain than 4.

## Solution:

- **sort words** on length
- start iterating each word, starting from the longest one
  - if the length of this word is **shorter** than the **current best chain** break the cycle: it is **impossible** to find a longer chain
  - call recursive function on the current word:
    - check for **memoized value**: this word has already been calculated, return already found result
    - iterate **each character** in the string (`s`):
      - generate a **substring** without this character
      - if this substring is in words (recursion **base case**):
        - calculate **chain** for this **substring** (recursively)
      - save result (1 if the substring is not in words) only if **bigger than best** found chain
  - save result only if longer than current best chain

## Code:
```python
def solve(words, s):
  if s in mem:
    return mem[s]

  res = -1
  for i in range(len(s)):
    subString = s[:i]+s[i+1:]
    chain = 0
    if subString in words:
      chain = solve(words, subString)
    res = max(res, 1+chain)

  mem[s] = res
  return res

class Solution:
  def longestStrChain(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
    global mem
    mem = {}
    mem.clear()

    words.sort(key=len)

    res = -1
    for s in reversed(words):
      if len(s) <= res: break
      sol = solve(words, s)
      res = max(res, sol)

    print(res)
    return res
```
