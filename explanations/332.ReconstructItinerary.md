## Idea:

Consider airports as **nodes** and tickets as **edges of a graph**.
Start at a desired point _(JFK)_ and iterate over all **adjacent points** _(airports reachable with a single not used ticket from JFK)_. Pick the **smallest one** in terms of lexical order. **Try calculating** result for the node the smallest edges points to _(try travelling to the airport with smallest lexical order next to current point and try to complete the travel from there)_.
If the solution is possible then we found a solution, otherwise (dead end) try the **second smallest edge** _(airport)_ in lexical order and so on.
This is achieved by **recursion**.
Each adjacency list of the graph is **sorted** at generation, so it is really easy to try the first smallest one and if solution is not found try the second smallest.

## Solution:

- **generate graph** (adjacency list graph): each list is **sorted**, convenient for later
- start **recursion**: try to solve the problem starting from JFK (`cur`)
  - if the **length of the path** is the same as **number of tickets** _(+1 to compensate starting JFK)_ then the problem is over, **all tickets used**
  - otherwise start iterating all **adjacent edges** to current node _(iterate available tickets)_. These are sorted in lexical order at graph creation
    - **remove selected** destination from graph _(ticket used, we cannot use it again in future)_
    - **add to the path** the selected destination
    - **calculate the result** for this selected destination
      - if the solution is **valid** (`res[0] == True`) then a valid solution is found, **return** this solution
      - otherwise solution for selected destination is **not valid** _(dead end)_
        - **restore** the edge _(ticket)_ that we removed as used (and **sort again** the adjacency list/tickets)
        - then the **cycle will continue**, so the second smallest lexical order will be calculated and tried _(if no solution found again the third will be tried, and so on...)_
    - if the cycle ends then **no valid solution** was found: this is a dead end (return `False`)

## Code:
```python
def buildGraph(tickets):
  graph = {}
  for t in tickets:
    fr = t[0]
    to = t[1]
    if fr in graph:
      graph[fr].append(to)
    else:
      graph[fr] = [ to ]
    if to not in graph:
      graph[to] = []
  for k in graph:
    graph[k].sort()
  return graph

def solve(nTickets, graph, cur, path):

  if len(path) == nTickets+1:
    return True, path

  for to in graph[cur]:
    # newG = copy.deepcopy(graph)
    graph[cur].remove(to)
    newP = path.copy()
    newP.append(to)
    res = solve(nTickets, graph, to, newP)
    if res[0]:
      return True, res[1]
    # revert graph to old state
    graph[cur].append(to)
    graph[cur].sort()

  return False, []

class Solution(object):
  def findItinerary(self, tickets):
    """
    :type tickets: List[List[str]]
    :rtype: List[str]
    """
    graph = buildGraph(tickets)
    path = solve(len(tickets), graph, "JFK", ["JFK"])
    print(path)
    return path[1]
```

## Older ideas:

- use some sort of modified dijkstra on a 3D graph (3rd dimension is time, to allow visiting multiple times the same node/airport)
  - problem: reconstruct the path
  - problem: cycles in the queue could be formed
  - result: solution rejected immediately, without even trying to implement it
- use an algorithm to visit all edges of a graph
